We have made changes to our code in two places, 4 lines of code in total:

 - When removing an entry from a hash table, we needed to check whether it had
   a "next" node in the same hash-list and update their "prev" pointer accordingly.
    + HashTable.cpp:103: if(it->next) it->next->prev = it->prev;
    + HashTable.cpp:108: if(it->next) it->next->prev = it;
 
 - When expanding a dynamic array, instead of copying the whole array in the end
   of the loop that update the nodes parent, left and right pointers,
   we should've copyed each entry immediatly after updating the pointers.
    + DynamicArray.cpp:45: new_root[i] = *it;
    - DynamicArray.cpp:46: memcpy(new_root, array->root, array->capacity * sizeof(Node));
